Most themes you can integrate using a few different ways. One of the simplest ways
is to *fork* the repo.

1. Choose the theme you like
2. Fork the repo into your github repos
3. Rename the repo to the name of your account
4. `git clone <<your cloned repo url>`
5. Start modifying the new template with what you'd like in your website!

Remember to give credit and have the link to the original github repo of the theme.
