# Hello Girls Who Code!

This project will help you make a porfolio website and blog website to post your future coding projects.

For this project, we'll be using pen names for safety. This can be changed later.

## Why make a porfolio/blog website?

To show off your cool projects of course and will be an AMAZING asset for the future to build off of! In this day and age, most everyone should have a website especially programmers.
For developers, it can be a minimal website. If you're a designer, it would be good to make it pretty.

This will be your space. Do whatever you'd like with it.

As an example: here's my website created with the tools we'll walk you through. I made this website in about 3 days. Then tweaked it for another few days.

## Why Git and Github?

**If you get an internship, you will be use a source control software like git and a git hosting service like github.**

Git is a source control software. Github is a hosting service for git repositories. To collaborate with others, we use hosts like github in the industry.

Additionally, Github provides another service called Github Pages that hosts your website for free and is compatible with Jekyll.

## Why Jekyll?

Free! And customizable and people in the coding world will think you're really cool for setting this up.
There are many different **themes** out there so you can choose what your website looks like easily!
